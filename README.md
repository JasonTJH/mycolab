# mycolab -- My Google Colab Projects

# TopNewFollowers_Twitter features scrapping the top growing Twitter profiles via Social Bakers website.
  ## Inspiration: Netflix series Money Heist co-stars once mentioned their surge in social media followers as they realised something big was happening...
  ## Objective: To find top trending & upcoming micro celebrity profiles before mainstream public via public social media data (for free!) 
  1. Scrapping the top profiles "href"s of each supported country by going thru the web server directory
  2. Using Selenium to obtain their follower counts over the past 6 months (from a javascript chart) - which is time consuming but necessary
  3. Filtering results to obtain profiles with at least 10k followers and on a steady rising trend
  4. Computing, categorizing & ranking profiles with various metric such as pct_change, # of followers, country, industry
  5. Outputs top profiles under the set variables (e.g. highest pct_chg in follower count over 2 weeks)
  
# Vid2Pdf features the conversion of typical education video slideshows (with or without talking heads) to proper ppt or pdf slides.
  ## Inspiration: A real need I faced personally as some presenters are unwilling to share their slides even for educational purposes
  ## Objective: To convert video slideshows to clean slides without any loss of quality (and slides!)
